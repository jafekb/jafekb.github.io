I have recently developed an interest in the field of vexillology: the study of flags. I think flags are so interesting: they really have power to bring a large group of people together and allow them to demonstrate pride in their shared experience. For example, I grew up in California, my wife grew up in Maryland, and we both now live in Massachusetts. Of the flags from those three states given below, can you guess which one nobody knows? I'll give you a hint: it's the one with a single seal in the middle of a single color, the same as 28 other states.

Massachusetts residents miss out on the opportunity that Californians and Marylanders have of rallying around a common shared icon. My wife loves seeing the Maryland flag in unexpected places: it reminds her of home, it has a lot of positive associations with things she loves, and it gives a feeling of comraderie with other Marylanders. On the other hand, neither of us would recognize the Massachusetts flag.  
However, that is changing! On 11 Jan 2021, Governer Charlie Baker organized a commission to create a new state flag! That had more to do with the fact that the particular boring seal that was chosen for our boring flag was of a Native American with a knife over his head, and _not_ just because it was boring, but it's a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the commission was supposed to have their final product done by October 2021 but [have been delayed][globe-flag-behind].

There are a bunch of fun online resources about vexillology like [this serious subreddit][r-vexillology], [this silly subreddit][r-vexillology-circlejerk], [the wikipedia article][vexil-wiki], [Good Flag, Bad Flag][good-flag-bad-flag], [this TED talk about bad city flags][bad-flags], ETC. Apparently vexillology has only a very short history, being officially distinguished from the broader field of heraldry in the late 1950's by a guy named Whitney Smith. What probably put the field of vexillology on the map for many people was Roman Mars' funny TED talk about terrible city flags. In it, he introduces the 5 Unofficial Official Rules of flag design from the North American Vexillological Association, or NAVA, and egregious examples of city flags breaking those rules (the worst being the Pocatello, ID flag)[^1].

Those 5 Rules are:
1. Keep It Simple.  The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
2. Use Meaningful Symbolism.  The flag's images, colors, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes.
3. Use 2 or 3 Basic Colors.  Limit the number of colors on the flag to three which contrast well and come from the standard color set.
4. No Lettering or Seals.  Never use writing of any kind or an organization's seal.
5. Be Distinctive or Be Related.  Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections.


With this short history in mind, let's take a look at the many flags that make an appearance in Barcelona, Spain, and what they tell us about the history and present of the city.

[^1]: However, many of the most extreme victims of Mars' criticism responded saying that the "flags" that were sent as the result of his survey were really the result of somebody saying 'Well, we don't really have a _flag_, per se, but I guess this emblem on a piece of paper counts as a representation of our city?"
