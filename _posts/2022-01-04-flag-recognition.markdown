I have recently developed an interest in the field of vexillology: the study of flags. I think flags are so interesting: they really have power to bring a large group of people together and allow them to demonstrate pride in their shared experience. For example, I grew up in California, my wife grew up in Maryland, and we both now live in Massachusetts. Of the flags from those three states given below, can you guess which one nobody knows? I'll give you a hint: it's the one with a single seal in the middle of a single color, the same as 28 other states.

Massachusetts residents miss out on the opportunity that Californians and Marylanders have of rallying around a common shared icon. My wife loves seeing the Maryland flag in unexpected places: it reminds her of home, it has a lot of positive associations with things she loves, and it gives a feeling of comraderie with other Marylanders. On the other hand, neither of us would recognize the Massachusetts flag.  
However, that is changing! On 11 Jan 2021, Governer Charlie Baker organized a commission to create a new state flag! That had more to do with the fact that the particular boring seal that was chosen for our boring flag was of a Native American with a knife over his head, and _not_ just because it was boring, but it's a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the commission was supposed to have their final product done by October 2021 but [have been delayed][globe-flag-behind].

There are a bunch of fun online resources about vexillology like [this serious subreddit][r-vexillology], [this silly subreddit][r-vexillology-circlejerk], [the wikipedia article][vexil-wiki], [Good Flag, Bad Flag][good-flag-bad-flag], [this TED talk about bad city flags][bad-flags], ETC. Apparently vexillology has only a very short history, being officially distinguished from the broader field of heraldry in the late 1950's by a guy named Whitney Smith. What probably put the field of vexillology on the map for many people was Roman Mars' funny TED talk about terrible city flags. In it, he introduces the 5 Unofficial Official Rules of flag design from the North American Vexillological Association, or NAVA, and egregious examples of city flags breaking those rules (the worst being the Pocatello, ID flag)[^1].
![pocatello flag](/images/pocatello_flag.jpeg)


Those 5 Rules are:
1. Keep It Simple.  The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
2. Use Meaningful Symbolism.  The flag's images, colors, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes.
3. Use 2 or 3 Basic Colors.  Limit the number of colors on the flag to three which contrast well and come from the standard color set.
4. No Lettering or Seals.  Never use writing of any kind or an organization's seal.
5. Be Distinctive or Be Related.  Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections.


With this short history in mind, let's take a look at the many flags that make an appearance in Barcelona, Spain, and what they tell us about the history and present of the city.

### EU Flag
<insert EU flag here>
You will often see three or four flags posted side-by-side in Spain, representing the location in descending order of specificity: The EU, Spain, Catalonia, and then (sometimes) Barcelona. The American analogue of this would be to include the country, state, and city flags all together, which is a very common sight in the USA. Spain joined the European Economic Community (EEC), the precursor to the European Union (EU) in 1986, the same year that the EU flag was adopted. But, this is a post about flags in Spain, not about the EU, so I will leave the determination of any more information about Spain's involvement in the EU as an exercise to the reader.

### Spain Flag
<insert Spain flag here>
![spain-flag](/images/spanish_flag.jpg)  
The Spanish flag is colloquially called the "Rojigualda", which could be surprising to modern Spanish speakers who might expect something like "Rojiamarilla." However, the _gualda_ refers to a more archaic Spanish word for that off-yellow gold color present in the flag. It was designed by a guy named Antonio Valdes y Bazan in 1785, being used purely for naval purposed until 1820 when it started to be used for more general-purpose Spanish representation. Something interesting about the flag itself is that this design, with the two horizontal stripes on top and bottom, with the middle section being equal in size to both of them combined, is called a _Spanish fess_, because this flag is the most common example of the design. I really like this flag: the colors, the organization and the off-center seal all walk the right line between simple and unique.

### Catalonia flag
Catalonia is one of the nineteen states in Spain, known as _autonomous communities. However, the Catalan flag, or _Senyera_, is featured on the flags of three other surrounding autonomous communities, and represents the Catalonian "nationality" which has very strong roots, dating back to the kingdom of Aragon which united with Spain in 1137. Catalan pride is huge in this region and has increased significantly since the 2010's, so it is very common to see this flag flown around Barcelona. This flag is definitely seen much more than the Spanish flag.

### Catalan Independence flag
<insert Estelada flag>
<insert cuban flag>
More common than the Catalan flag is the Catalan independence flag, a sort of mash-up of the Catalan flag with the Cuban flag (see the comparison above). You see it on balconies everywhere - many people fly the Catalan independence flag. It is called the _Estelada_, which can roughly be translated as "The Lone Star Flag." It was actually created in conjunction with a new Constitution that Catalonia wrote as part of an assembly in 1931 which established Catalan independence for a grand total of three days before it was integrated into the Spanish republic.

### Red Estelada
<insert red estelada>
It is also common to see a red _estelada_, very similar to the blue one. This one is more specifically called the "vermella." It represents similar Catalan independence desires, but has a more socialist bent. It dates back to around the 70s when socialism was very popular in Spain.

### Black and white Catalan
<insert black and white>
This pirate-esque flag was first hoisted in July 2014 at the Museum of History of Catalonia. It commemorates the defense of the castle of Montjuic by Catalan people against Philip V in the year 1714 (thus the name _tricentennial_). The cross is the Cross of St. Eulalia, and is formed from two V's, for "Votar" and "Victoria."

### Barcelona flag
And now we finally come to the flag of the city. It is very rare in the US to see city flags flown, in fact very few cities have flags that were designed with any amount of care like they would ever be flown. However, that is not always the case here in Spain. The Barcelona flag, shown here, really encapsulates the spirit of the city. It is composed of the Catalan Senyera, and the cross of St Jordi, the patron saint of the city. Legend says that he saved a woman from a dragon,

[^1]: However, many of the most extreme victims of Mars' criticism responded saying that the "flags" that were sent as the result of his survey were really the result of somebody saying 'Well, we don't really have a _flag_, per se, but I guess this emblem on a piece of paper counts as a representation of our city?"
