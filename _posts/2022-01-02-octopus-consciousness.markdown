I recently finished reading Ray Bradbury's _Fahrenheit 451_, so I was in the market for a new book to read. I opened Libby and scrolled through the immediately-available audiobooks from my local library. As is my habit, as soon as I found a book with the word `consciousness` in the title, I downloaded it.
The book was _Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness_ by Peter Godfrey-Smith. It is fascinating, and a perfect addition to my collection of ardently anti-human exceptionalism literature. This book added octopuses to my list of creatures who threaten the idea of human exceptionalism. The fascinating point that Godfrey-Smith points out, though, is that octopuses are unique in their similarity to human intelligence because of how distant their relationship is to us evolutionarily. They are the most intelligent animals outside of the Phylum Cordata, the phylum which includes vertebrates, and therefore all mammals, including humans. Look at this figure to see how distant the relationship between humans and cephalopods is:

What this means is that  
```
Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.
```
The importance of this insight cannot be overstated. Intelligence in all mammals is a form of _divergent evolution_, "the process whereby groups from the same common ancestor evolve and accumulate differences" [source][divergent-evolution]. A single mammalian ancestor developed a complex central nervous system including a central brain and spinal cord, and different mammals have continued to branch out and improve this general structure over many millions of years. However, the common ancestry of cephalopods and mammals diverged _before_ the development of complex nervous systems! So any intelligence present in an octopus was developed entirely independently from humans.
