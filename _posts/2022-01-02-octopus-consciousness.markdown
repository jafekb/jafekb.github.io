I recently finished reading Ray Bradbury's _Fahrenheit 451_, so I was in the market for a new book to read. I opened Libby and scrolled through the immediately-available audiobooks from my local library. As is my habit, as soon as I found a book with the word _consciousness_ in the title, I downloaded it.
The book was _Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness_ by Peter Godfrey-Smith. It is fascinating, and a perfect addition to my collection of ardently anti-human exceptionalism literature. This book added octopuses to my list of creatures who threaten the idea of human exceptionalism. The fascinating point that Godfrey-Smith points out, though, is that octopuses are unique in their similarity to human intelligence because of how distant their relationship is to us evolutionarily. They are the most intelligent animals outside of the Phylum Cordata, the phylum which includes vertebrates, and therefore all mammals, including humans. Look at this figure to see how distant the relationship between humans and cephalopods is:

What this means is that  
```
Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate
animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies
so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution
of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with
cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history,
not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This
is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.
```
The importance of this insight cannot be overstated. Intelligence in all mammals is a form of _divergent evolution_, "the process whereby groups from the same common ancestor evolve and accumulate differences" ([source][divergent-evolution]).
A single mammalian ancestor developed a complex central nervous system including a central brain and spinal cord, and different mammals have continued to branch out and improve this general structure over many millions of years. However, the common ancestry of cephalopods and mammals diverged _before_ the development of complex nervous systems! So any intelligence present in an octopus was developed entirely independently from humans. It brings to mind a line from a book which should be included in any discussion of the origins of intelligence, Hofstadters' _Godel, Escher, Bach_:  
```
It would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than
‘that which gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols that we do’…
We should try to formulate in some independent way a set of characteristics
which deserve the name ‘intelligence’. Such characteristics would constitute
the uniform core of intelligence, which is shared by humans… there may be
some elegant and beautiful- perhaps even simple- abstract way of characterizing
the essence of intelligence.
```
The study of octopuses provides us with a unique opportunity to study what intelligence could look like in an organism very different from ourselves, to give us insight into this possibly-existent centralized definition of intelligence.  
And octopuses do have some very key differences from humans in terms of their brain structure and function. In all mammals, the neurons are centralized in the brain, with a spinal cord acting as a central transmission of nerve signals to the body. However, in octopuses, more than 50% of their 500,000,000 neurons lie outside the central brain, in the tentacles. This structure has some interesting effects: tentacles can perform all of their basic functions for hours after being severed from their dead owner ([source][dead-tentacles]). This brings to mind images of the buggers from Card's _Ender's Game_, in which hundreds of separate organisms act as one while being controlled by a single "queen". 

### TODO
1. Misunderstanding animals
    a. invertebrates not covered under anti-cruelty laws
    b. de Waal's Ignobel Prize butts
2. vertebrates
    a. Ender's game: buggers
