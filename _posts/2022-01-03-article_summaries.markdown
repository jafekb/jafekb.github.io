### Sentience in Sephalopod Molluscs and Decapod Crustaceans
**Author(s):** Jonathan Birch, Charlotte Burn, Alexandra Schnell, Heather Browning and Andrew Crump
**Date:** Nov 2021

This article is a very interesting report out of the UK that concludes that octopuses and crabs have enough sentience that they should be protected under animal anti-cruelty laws, specifically the Animal Welfare Act of 2006. To me, "sentience" feels like a very strong word, but they are talking about just being able to feel and process pain. They define sentience as "the capacity to have feelings." 
It is an important conclusion and makes me think about my consumption of octopus and crab, especially given that this report is only coming out now. The recency highlights how little we know about the inner state of invertebrates. They explicitly mention that they are not going to propose legislation changes as part of this report, but they do mention a few specifics of practices that are highly probable to be unethical, given our understanding of cephalopod behaviors and feelings. For example, presence of dark shelters is very important for crabs and octopuses.  

However, in my opinion, the most interesting part of this study was the methods that they used to determine whether or not the animals were sentient. This feels like a much further-reaching result of this study. They determined 8 criteria: 
1. The animal possesses receptors sensitive to noxious stimuli (nociceptors).
2. The animal possesses integrative brain regions capable of integrating information from different sensory sources.
3. The animal possesses neural pathways connecting the nociceptors to the integrative brain regions.
4. The animalâ€™s behavioural response to a noxious stimulus is modulated by chemical compounds affecting the nervous system.
5. The animal shows motivational trade-offs, in which the disvalue of a noxious or threatening stimulus is weighed (traded-off) against the value of an opportunity for reward, leading to flexible decision-making.
6. The animal shows flexible self-protective behaviour of a type likely to involve representing the bodily location of a noxious stimulus.
7. The animal shows associative learning in which noxious stimuli become associated with neutral stimuli, and/or in which novel ways of avoiding noxious stimuli are learned through reinforcement. Note: habituation and sensitisation are not sufficient to meet this criterion.
8. The animal shows that it values a putative analgesic or anaesthetic when injured.

In sum, 1-4 are related to the animal's physical ability to feel pain; 5-8 are related to behavior patterns that suggest that the animal is processing the pain in a way that we would expect if the animal were understanding the pain. Very interesting to think about applying these same criteria to other animals. And a final point - these criteria seem like awfully low standards, it's crazy that it has taken this long for this much research to be compiled about cephalopods.
