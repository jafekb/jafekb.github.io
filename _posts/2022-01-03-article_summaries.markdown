# Article summaries
Summaries of articles that I read that I think are interesting. Probable topics will include: machine learning, perception, autonomy, consciousness, ethology (especially cognitive ethology), artificial intelligence.

### Sentience in Sephalopod Molluscs and Decapod Crustaceans
**Author(s):** Jonathan Birch, Charlotte Burn, Alexandra Schnell, Heather Browning and Andrew Crump
**Date:** Nov 2021

This article is a very interesting report out of the UK that concludes that octopuses and crabs have enough sentience that they should be protected under animal anti-cruelty laws, specifically the Animal Welfare Act of 2006. To me, "sentience" feels like a very strong word, but they are talking about just being able to feel and process pain. They define sentience as "the capacity to have feelings." 
It is an important conclusion and makes me think about my consumption of octopus and crab, especially given that this report is only coming out now. The recency highlights how little we know about the inner state of invertebrates. They explicitly mention that they are not going to propose legislation changes as part of this report, but they do mention a few specifics of practices that are highly probable to be unethical, given our understanding of cephalopod behaviors and feelings. For example, presence of dark shelters is very important for crabs and octopuses.  

However, in my opinion, the most interesting part of this study was the methods that they used to determine whether or not the animals were sentient. This feels like a much further-reaching result of this study. They determined 8 criteria: 
1. The animal possesses receptors sensitive to noxious stimuli (nociceptors).
2. The animal possesses integrative brain regions capable of integrating information from different sensory sources.
3. The animal possesses neural pathways connecting the nociceptors to the integrative brain regions.
4. The animalâ€™s behavioural response to a noxious stimulus is modulated by chemical compounds affecting the nervous system.
5. The animal shows motivational trade-offs, in which the disvalue of a noxious or threatening stimulus is weighed (traded-off) against the value of an opportunity for reward, leading to flexible decision-making.
6. The animal shows flexible self-protective behaviour of a type likely to involve representing the bodily location of a noxious stimulus.
7. The animal shows associative learning in which noxious stimuli become associated with neutral stimuli, and/or in which novel ways of avoiding noxious stimuli are learned through reinforcement. Note: habituation and sensitisation are not sufficient to meet this criterion.
8. The animal shows that it values a putative analgesic or anaesthetic when injured.

In sum, 1-4 are related to the animal's physical ability to feel pain; 5-8 are related to behavior patterns that suggest that the animal is processing the pain in a way that we would expect if the animal were understanding the pain. Very interesting to think about applying these same criteria to other animals. And a final point - these criteria seem like awfully low standards, it's crazy that it has taken this long for this much research to be compiled about cephalopods.

### Sapolsky's Human Behavioral Biology Lectures
**Author(s)**: Professor Robert Sapolsky
**Date:** Feb 2011 (recurring course though)

For some reason, a bunch of the Stanford Youtube channel's top videos are a series of lectures by a super interesting neuroendicrinology researcher professor there named Robert Sapolsky (his "Introduction to Human Behavioral Biology" class has 11 million views). Maybe as a response to that question, the lectures are fascinating. I watched major portions of 3 of them, with my thoughts summarized below:  
1. [Introduction to Human Behavioral Biology][sapolsky-intro]
As a good introduction to the topic, Sapolsky was at his best in terms of asking interesting questions, providing witty remarks, and teasing the particularly interesting portions of the course. The 57-minute long class was basically a highlight reel of interesting ways in which behavioral biology affects everyday life of everyday people. In his words, If I had to give an "overarching theme", it would be his question to the class with an obvious answer:
```
Who thinks it's all explained by nature? *crickets*
Ok, who thinks it's all explained by nurture? *laughter*
Who thinks there's a magnificent, fascinating, nuanced interaction between nature and nurture?
```
Some other highlights:
* "The first [intellectual challenge] is recognizing circumstances where there is nothing fancy about us whatsoever, we are just like every other animal out there." He gives the example of what he calls the Wellesley Effect, but I have seen elsewhere called the McClintlock effect, where women's menstrual cycles sync if they live together for long enough. It highlights the importance of pheromones which we can smell but cannot recognize (pheromones also affect many romantic relationships). Some further insights about it he provides, which is true for both human and non-human females:
  - The cycles will sync to the "dominant" female, in the human case meaning the more socially dominant or extroverted woman
  - The cycles will NOT sync if either of the females are consistently around another man
* One way in which humans are uniquely capable about us is the following situation: 2 grandmaster chess players can maintain blood pressure for 6 hours running equivalent to that of a marathon runner. They are burning thousands of calories a day doing nothing more than thinking.
* Unfortunately, Conrad Lorenz, the founder of ethology and the guy who did a bunch of work on imprinting birds to himself, was a big deal in the Nazi party and held Nazi ideals with him until he died (BUT his wikipedia page has a quote where he says he regrets it...).
 
 "I really think this is a subject that everybody on Earth should be forced to learn about at gunpoint... Everybody has to learn behavioral biology because we're being behavioral biologists all the time. So it's probably a good thing to be informed ones."

2. [Stanford's Sapolsky on Depression in US][sapolsky-depression]
This one had a couple of interesting points:
* He claims that depression is the worst disease out there:
```
When you want to come to basic meat and potatoes of human medical
misery, there is nothing out there like depression. Depression is
absolutely crippling. Depression is the worst disease you can get.
You look at somebody with one of our major diseases like cancer or
heart disease, and you see the most unlikely things out there. They
say 'well, obviously I'm not glad I'm dying of cancer, but without
this disease I never would have realized the importance of friends,
I never would have found my god... I'm almost glad this is happening
to me.' What could possibly be worse than a disease whose defining
symptom is the inability to feel pleasure?"
```
* He says that the reason depression can leave people exhausted all the time is that thinking takes energy (like he mentioned about chess masters in the intro). So thinking very stressful or emotional thoughts takes a lot of energy, which saps the body.
* Freud: "Depression is aggression turned inwards."
* Depression is "learned helpnessness," caused and/or exacerbated by being in situations where you are sad and feel like you can't do anything about it.
* There is strong (read: nearly undeniable) biological evidence of depression.


3. [Schizophrenia][sapolsky-schiz]
He says that the defining characteristic of a schizophrenic person is their inability to think abstractly. So if you say "What do the words _apple_, _banana_, _orange_ have in common?" They will say things like "They're multisyllabic words" and if you push deeper, maybe "They each have closed round vowels in them" and they'll never get around to mentioning that they're all fruit.
Elizabeth just finished a book on schizophrenia which had a little bit of a different view about it, but both that book and this video highlight how little we understand about schizophrenia. He says that maybe we can look at schizophrenia as more of a symptom of disease rather than the disease itself.


### Creative or created: Using anecdotes to investigate animal cognition
**Author(s)**: Lucy Anne Bates (Univ. Sussex), Richard W Byrne (Univ. St. Andrews)
**Date:** June 2007

My interest in this paper was sparked by a comment made in Godfrey-Smith's _Other Minds_ about the difficulty in replicating anecdotal animal behavior with rigorous scientific evidence. It is very interesting: the key idea is that anyone observing animals for a long enough period of time will notice them doing interesting things: maybe strange, impressive, or intelligent. However, because we often don't understand animals well enough, it can be very difficult to convince them to replicate those behaviors in controlled experiments that would allow us to explain them. Maybe we want to convince ourselves that the tool usage was pre-planned, or that the language demonstration was intentional and understood, or that the animal really understood what it was doing. But maybe the monkey isn't motivated strongly enough by a nut to perform a difficult behavior to get it; or we don't understand the social behavior of the octopus enough to be able to reproduce the environment that prompted it to stand on its tentacles; our ignorance of animal umwelt is infinite. As a result, anecdotes will always be more interesting than data.
So the point of this paper is to talk about how to effectively use anecdotes in scientific study, using the African elephant as a case study.
They start out saying that "to date, very few empirical studies that investigate the intelligence or creativity of elephants have been published. Although the social ecology of wild elephants, both African and Asian species, has been studied for many decades and is now comparitively well understood, still remarkably little is known about the cognitive capacities of these esteemed animals."
Quotes:
```
Using anecdotal records allows us to consider the full range of
behaviour that occurs naturally in a species, including their
most creative aptitudes, rather than restricting the focus to
paradigms already familiar from systematic study of other animal
species and humans. This then allows us to generate and define
appropriate hypotheses about cognitive capacities, with the aim
of subsequently developing rigorous but novel methodology for
experimental testing."
```
I think this is the most important part: "The plural of 'anecdote' is not 'data'", but rather "The plural of 'anecdote' is 'an important research question'".  
It reminds me of Asimov's quote: "The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'" - anecdotes are the "that's funny..."'s of scientific study, which is important especially in a field where rigorous proof is so difficult. You have to be very convinced that the animal will demonstrate the behavior you're looking for if only you could create the right experiment, and you become convinced by having a lot of anecdotal evidence.
So, they talk about a few ways to use anecdotes responsibly:
1. rare events
- "ad libitum": something strange you've never seen before. E.g., infanticide in primates. Frith in 2005 recorded it for a long time, realized that it had been observed for almost 100 years but everyone had been independently writing it off as a one-off occurrence. (!)
- "focal behavior sampling": an event that you can record in full, it is just observed rarely, like predation or birth.

3 criteria:
1. Observers experienced with the species. Example of chimpanzee "laughing happily" when really it is a fear grin. Even in these cases, it is important that the researcher "report only the behavior as observed," with no "anthropomorphic or mental state inferences."
2. Using records as they were originally recorded. Must be written down immediately and not re-told over and over again, something that would expose it to human memory reconstruction.
3. Multiple independent records of the same phenomenon. "One-off records are vulnerable to ambiguous interpretation: as coincidence, assident, misattribution, or observer error... The question of proper interpretation becomes tractable, however, if multiple records of behaviors exist. Once a set of similar records from similar circumstances begins to accumulate, the likelihood that the observed events were causally unrelated to the circumstances is reduced."

They [cite BF Skinner][skinner-no-mental] saying that "Psychologists have in the past argued that all human behavior could be explained without mental states," which feels a little disingenuous. BUT their point is that if you can do it for humans, you can _definitely_ do it for animals, so if you _can't_ do it for humans, does that tell you anything about what you assume about animals? Not super convincing but an interesting though experiment.

Some other researchers conclude after looking at a bunch of anecdotes about animal teaching behaviors that it is "unnecessary to make assumptions about what the instructor knows about the pupil's beliefs, desires, or motives." (re: theory of mind).

(TODO: This only goes through section 2.2)
