This is the public half of Ben Jafek's blog, where I write about stuff that I think is interesting. Most of it is things that I think I can't find elsewhere on the internet, but some things will be pretty direct copies from other sources that I just want to learn more about. See the
[Future Posts](./_posts/2022-01-02-future-posts.markdown]) post for information about things I think I might write about in the future. I am not _yet_ a very good writer, so read at your own peril.
